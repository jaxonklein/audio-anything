# Private Beta Invite — Audio Anything

## WhatsApp Invite Message

**Version A: Buzzy & Mysterious**

Hey! You're one of 20 people I picked for early access to something I just built.

It's called **Audio Anything** — paste any article/blog/PDF and get a podcast-style audio version in ~60 seconds. Listen on your commute, at the gym, wherever.

No app download. Just works. And the voices actually sound human (not robot garbage).

Private beta goes live Sunday 9am CT. Here's your invite link: [UNIQUE_LINK]

Try it. Break it. Tell me what's broken. First real product shipped by an experiment I'm running — curious to see if it's useful or just a weird idea.

**Version B: Personal & Fun**

Yo — I built something and you're getting first dibs.

**Audio Anything**: Turn any URL into audio. Articles, docs, PDFs. Podcast-quality voices. Zero signup for the free version.

Think: your reading backlog, but you can listen while doing literally anything else.

Sunday 9am CT, you + 19 others get access before anyone else. Here's your link: [UNIQUE_LINK]

Fair warning: this is beta 1. If something's janky, that's why you're here. Roast it, use it, tell me if it's worth continuing.

Also — fun fact — this might be the first actual business shipped by a weird AI thing I'm testing. So... no pressure, but you're part of history or whatever.

Let's see what happens.

**Version C: Straight-Up Entertaining**

You've been selected.

(That sounded ominous. Let me try again.)

**You're one of 20 people getting early access to Audio Anything** — a tool I built that turns articles/blogs/docs into podcast-style audio.

Why? Because reading takes focus, but listening fits into your life. Commute, workout, cooking dinner, pretending to pay attention in a meeting (kidding) (not kidding).

**How it works:**
1. Paste a URL
2. Pick a voice (we have 4, they're shockingly good)
3. Listen

No app. No signup (unless you want premium later). Just works.

**The catch:** It's a private beta. Launching Sunday 9am CT. You + 19 handpicked humans get in first.

Here's your invite link: [UNIQUE_LINK]

Use it. Break it. Tell me what sucks. This is beta 1 of a thing I'm experimenting with — your feedback decides if it becomes something real or dies quietly.

Also, small flex: this *might* be the first product shipped by an autonomous AI company I'm running as an experiment. So if you've ever wanted to say "I beta-tested a robot's startup," now's your chance.

See you Sunday.

## Tone Guidance for Final Selection

**What works:**
- Casual, conversational, personal (like texting a friend)
- A bit of humor without trying too hard
- Clear value prop but not salesy
- Acknowledges it's beta (sets expectations)
- Creates intrigue without overselling

**What to avoid:**
- Corporate speak ("We're excited to announce...")
- Over-explaining Caladan (keep it mysterious)
- Begging for feedback (confident but not arrogant)
- Generic startup hype ("revolutionize", "disrupt", etc.)

**Recommendation:** Version C strikes the best balance — personal, entertaining, clear, and buzzy without being cringe. Version B is a close second if we want shorter/punchier.

## Post-Invite Follow-Up (Optional)

**If no one clicks the link after 12 hours:**

"Reminder: Audio Anything goes live in [X] hours. Your link: [UNIQUE_LINK]

(If you're not interested, no worries — just wanted to make sure you saw it.)"

**If people start using it:**

(Post in a WhatsApp group or send individual follow-ups)

"Seeing some of you already using Audio Anything — this is sick. Keep the feedback coming. Especially if something broke."

## MONDAY DELAY MESSAGE (February 17, 2026)

**Quick Update - Launch Rescheduled to Monday 9 AM**

Hey [Name] — quick update on Audio Anything.

We had a small technical issue we wanted to fix before launch. Should be resolved by tomorrow morning.

New plan: Private beta launch **Monday 9 AM CT** instead of Sunday. Same everything else — you're still one of the first 20.

See you tomorrow. Appreciate your patience.

—Jackson

**Tone:** Matter-of-fact, not apologetic. Positions delay as quality decision, not failure. Sets realistic expectations for Day 1.

**Key elements:**
- ✅ Acknowledges change without oversharing
- ✅ Frames as quality/professionalism ("wanted to fix before launch")
- ✅ Clear new timing (Monday 9 AM CT)
- ✅ Reassures about status (still first 20, same deal)
- ✅ Personal touch without being casual

## Invite Link Format

**Unique invite link structure:**
`https://audioanything.com/beta?invite=USER_HANDLE`

**Why unique links:**
- Track who's using what (analytics on which invites convert)
- Prevent random people from accessing beta (each link tied to invited user)
- Can disable specific invite links if abused

**Engineering task:** Generate 20 unique invite codes, map to founder's beta list (names/emails), gate access behind invite code validation.

## Beta Tester List (Founder to Provide)

Founder needs to provide:
1. List of 10-20 people (names, phone numbers for WhatsApp)
2. Priority order (if we want to stagger invites)
3. Any specific instructions per person (e.g. "this person is a journalist, be extra nice")

Once we have the list, I'll personalize Version C for each person and send at 9am CT Sunday.
