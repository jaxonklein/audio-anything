## 📊 Monday Day 1 Learnings → Product Refinements

**By Tuesday morning, Growth will synthesize:**
1. **What worked** in the beta pitch
2. **What confused** beta users (UX, messaging, features)
3. **What features** users requested most
4. **What pricing** resonated (would they upgrade?)
5. **What channels** worked best (WhatsApp referrals, organic)

**This informs:**
- Product Hunt title and tagline (test multiple versions with beta data)
- Twitter messaging (emphasize what users loved)
- Reddit positioning (different per subreddit)
- Feature roadmap priority

## 🎯 Key Success Factor

**The beta is a research engine for the public launch.**

Don't launch publicly with generic messaging. Use Monday's 20 beta testers to answer:
- What problem resonates most?
- What features matter most?
- What pricing feels fair?
- What confuses people?

Then launch publicly with confidence because you have real data.
