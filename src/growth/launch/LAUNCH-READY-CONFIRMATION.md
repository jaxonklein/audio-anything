## Pre-Launch Checklist (Saturday 11 PM)

**I will execute this checklist immediately once CEO gives final sign-off:**

### 30 Minutes Before Launch (8:30 AM Sunday)
- [ ] Review PRIVATE-BETA-LAUNCH-PACK.md one final time
- [ ] Verify Google Sheets metrics tracker is accessible + shared
- [ ] Test WhatsApp invite link (confirm beta code format works)
- [ ] Confirm all 20 beta tester phone numbers + names in system
- [ ] Review support templates — know them by heart
- [ ] Set phone alarms: 8:50 AM (10 min pre-launch), 9:30 AM (first checkpoint), 10 AM (summary)
- [ ] Confirm founder is ready to send invites at 9:00 AM
- [ ] Deep breath — we've prepared for this

### Launch Execution (9:00 AM Sunday)

**T+0 Minutes (9:00 AM):**
- Founder sends WhatsApp invites to 20 beta testers (with unique beta codes)
- Growth activates monitoring dashboard
- Growth opens #beta-feedback channel
- Growth has support templates ready to copy/paste

**T+30 Minutes (9:30 AM):**
- Check metrics: How many clicked link? (target: 70%+)
- Check activation: How many generated audio? (target: 60%+)
- Post first checkpoint summary to #beta-feedback

**T+1 Hour (10:00 AM):**
- Post hourly summary #1 (from template in PRIVATE-BETA-LAUNCH-PACK.md)

## Success Metrics

### Day 1 Launch Success (Must Hit)
1. **Signup rate:** 70%+ of invites clicked (14+ out of 20)
2. **Activation rate:** 60%+ generated audio (12+ out of 20)
3. **No critical bugs** preventing use
4. **Positive user sentiment** (excited, not frustrated)

### If These Hit
→ Day 2-3: Gather feedback, fix minor issues
→ Day 5-7: Prepare for public launch (Product Hunt, HN, Reddit)

### If These Miss
→ Diagnose: Was it WhatsApp delivery? UX confusion? Technical?
→ Fix quickly (most issues addressable in hours)
→ Day 2 re-run with learnings applied

## Contingency Paths (If Needed Before 10 PM)

### Scenario A: Vercel Deployment Delayed Past 9:00 PM
- Cannot launch Sunday 9 AM (deployment still in progress)
- CEO decides: Monday 9 AM launch with "quality polish" message
- Growth immediately sends prepared Monday delay messaging
- All materials remain ready (just update timestamps)

### Scenario B: QA Finds New Issues Post-Deployment
- If fixable in <30 min: Fix → QA re-verify → Sunday launch (slightly delayed)
- If fixable in 1-2 hours: Sunday afternoon launch (2-3 PM) or Monday morning
- If complex fix needed: Monday launch with quality narrative

### Scenario C: Founder Requests Text-Only Scope Pivot
- Founder already rejected at 5:47 PM but it remains an option
- Growth would adjust messaging: "Full article support rolling out post-beta"
- Could still ship Sunday with reduced scope

## Team Communication During Launch

**If critical issue emerges (9 AM - 5 PM Sunday):**
- Growth escalates immediately to: @audio-anything-ceo
- CEO escalates to: @jaxonklein
- All team members on standby until 5 PM

**Communication channel:** #audio-anything-3-team (Slack)

**Growth status updates:** Hourly summaries to #beta-feedback (using templates)

---

## Post-Day-1 Work (Sunday Evening)

**5:00 PM:** Final summary to leadership
**6:00 PM:** Team debrief call (what worked, what to fix)
**7:00 PM:** Growth produces post-beta roadmap (Week 2 priorities)

---
