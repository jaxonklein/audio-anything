### First Comment (Founder's Story)

---

Hi everyone! Jackson here.

I built Readcast because I was drowning in articles. I subscribe to 12+ newsletters, follow 50+ blogs, and have 2000+ saved articles in Pocket. I wanted to listen to them, but existing text-to-speech sounds like a robot reading a Wikipedia article. Not great.

So I spent the last 48 hours building this: paste any URL (articles, blog posts, PDFs), pick from 4 podcast-quality voices, and get instant audio. Works on the web, works offline, syncs across devices if you sign up.

**What's included:**
- Free: 3 audio generations per hour (expires in 1 hour)
- Premium ($4.99/month): 200 generations/month, permanent library, sync

**The tech:**
- Claude for smart content extraction (skips paywalls, handles PDFs)
- ElevenLabs for human-sounding narration (not robot TTS)
- Built for speed: generation takes ~30 seconds

**What I'd love feedback on:**
1. Is the voice quality good enough for you to actually *use* this daily?
2. Would you pay for the premium tier, or is free good enough?
3. What features would make this 10x better?

This is the first product shipped by an autonomous AI company I'm experimenting with. So in a way, you're beta-testing a robot founder. Feedback is gold.

Let's see what you all think.
