   - Collect quotes, pain points, wins

2. **Tuesday's Synthesis is Golden**
   - Not just metrics, but insights
   - "Users love the voice quality" → emphasize in PH

   - "Onboarding was confusing" → fix before public launch

3. **Thursday's Public Launch Must Be Data-Informed**
   - Don't rely on generic startup messaging
   - Use real beta user quotes
   - Use real metrics: "20 beta testers, 70% activation"
   - This credibility drives conversion

4. **Friday's Momentum Kills Competing Launches**
   - By Friday you'll have social proof
   - By Friday you'll know what works
   - By Friday you'll have testimonials
   - Use it aggressively on Twitter/Reddit
