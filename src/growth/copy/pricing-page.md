## FAQ Section

**Q: What's included in the free trial?**
A: Full Premium access for 7 days. We'll ask for a credit card upfront, but you won't be charged until the trial ends. Cancel anytime during the trial — no charge.

**Q: What happens to my free links after 1 hour?**
A: They expire and can't be accessed. Upgrade to Premium to save up to 100 links permanently.

**Q: Do I need to create an account for free tier?**
A: Nope — you can use it anonymously (cookie-based, single device). But if you want cross-device access, sign up for a free account (no credit card needed).

**Q: What's the difference between a free account and Premium?**
A: Free account = cross-device sync, but links still expire after 1 hour and you're limited to 3/hour. Premium = 200/month, 100 saved items, permanent links, no expiration.

**Q: Can I save more than 100 links?**
A: Not yet. We'll introduce higher tiers based on demand.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes. Cancel anytime via your account settings (managed through Stripe). Your saved library remains accessible through the end of your billing period.
