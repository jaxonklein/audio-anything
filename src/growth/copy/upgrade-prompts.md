## Copy Principles

1. **Always mention the free trial upfront** — "7-day free trial" should appear on every CTA
2. **Be honest about credit card requirement** — don't hide it, but frame it as standard
3. **Focus on the pain point:** losing access, losing your place, hitting rate limits
4. **Be specific:** "100 links", "$4.99/month", "1-hour expiration" — no vague language
5. **Create urgency without pressure:** "expires in 15 minutes" is factual, not manipulative
6. **Offer an out:** Every prompt has a "dismiss" or "not now" option

## A/B Test Variants

### Variant A: Emphasize trial
"⏰ Try Premium free for 7 days — save this audio permanently"

### Variant B: Emphasize pain point
"💔 Links expire in 1 hour. Premium keeps them forever."

### Variant C: Emphasize value
"📚 200 generations/month for $4.99. That's $0.02 per audio."

**Test systematically.** Track conversion rate by variant.

## Chat Widget CTA Variants

**Current:** "Talk directly to the CEO 😊"

**Funnier options:**

1. **"CEO's inbox (he actually replies)"**
2. **"Questions? Complaints? The CEO is listening."**
3. **"Talk to a human (yes, really)"**
4. **"Need help? Bug the CEO directly."**
5. **"Founder's hotline 📞"**
6. **"The CEO built this. Ask him why."**
7. **"Have feedback? The CEO will read it. Probably."**

**Recommendation:** Option 4 ("Need help? Bug the CEO directly.") — playful, implies responsiveness, low-key funny without trying too hard.
