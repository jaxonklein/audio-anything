## 🎯 Post-Monday (Day 1 Learnings)

### 5:00 PM Monday — End of Day Summary
Growth will post comprehensive learning synthesis:
- How many clicked link? How many generated audio?
- What worked? What needs fixing?
- Pattern analysis from support requests
- Sentiment analysis from user feedback

### 6:00 PM Monday — Team Debrief
Quick sync on what happened, what to fix next, priorities for Day 2-3

### Day 2-3 Actions
- Gather feedback, fix critical issues, monitor retention
- Determine what needs refinement before public launch

### Day 5-7 Actions
- Prepare for public launch (Product Hunt, Hacker News, Reddit)
- Refine messaging based on beta learnings

## 💡 Why Monday Makes Sense

### Sunday 9 AM (Blocked ❌)
- No time to verify fix is actually working in production
- Risk of launching broken product to 20 trusted early users
- Damage to founder credibility if something fails
- Time pressure prevents thorough QA

### Monday 9 AM (Ready ✅)
- 12+ hours to fully verify streaming endpoint fix works
- QA can do comprehensive testing
- CEO can review product end-to-end
- Growth has contingency plans ready
- Quality narrative ("small technical issue") maintains credibility
- Same launch operations plan, just 24-hour delay

**Founder's decision to prioritize quality over speed was strategically correct.** Better to delay 12 hours and launch with confidence than to rush and potentially damage credibility with early users.
