## 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKER — LAUNCH DELAYED TO MONDAY

**Status:** Streaming endpoint fix code is complete and merged (commit 86e8b35), but **Vercel deployment is blocked**.

**Problem:** Vercel not auto-deploying GitHub commits. Engineer lacks Vercel credentials. Founder must manually trigger deployment via Vercel dashboard to put fix into production.

**Time Impact:** 2 minutes remaining until 10 PM hard deadline. Cannot verify fix + execute launch in time.

**Recommendation:** Launch Monday 9 AM CT with quality polish narrative.

## 📊 Launch Timeline Analysis

### Sunday 9 AM Launch Path (BLOCKED)
**Critical path required:**
1. Founder manually deploys Vercel (2-3 min)

3. CEO sign-off (5 min)
4. Growth sends invites (5 min)
5. **Total time needed:** ~15-20 minutes
6. **Time available:** ~2 minutes ❌

**Verdict:** Impossible to execute with Vercel blocker at this time.

### Monday 9 AM Launch Path (READY)
**What needs to happen:**
1. Founder manually deploys Vercel when available (2-3 min)
2. QA tests streaming endpoint overnight (5-10 min)
3. CEO approves Monday launch (5 min)
4. Growth sends updated invites to 20 testers with Monday message (5 min)
5. Growth executes full Day 1 operations Monday 9 AM

## 🚀 Next Steps for Growth

### If Founder Deploys Tonight (Anytime Before Monday 9 AM)

3. **If test fails:** Engineer debugs, Growth stays on standby

### If Founder Does Not Deploy Tonight
1. **Monday morning:** Founder deploys at any point before 9 AM
2. **Growth pivots:** Updates Day 1 pack with Monday 9 AM timeline, sends updated invite message
3. **Growth executes:** Full Day 1 launch operations starting 9 AM Monday

### Growth's Current Status

## 📋 Monday Launch Messaging (Ready to Send)

**WhatsApp Invite to 20 Beta Testers:**
```
Hey [Name] — Audio Anything is going live Monday at 9 AM CT!

Quick update: We had a small technical issue we wanted to fix before launch.
Should be resolved by tomorrow morning.

New plan: Private beta launch **Monday 9 AM CT** instead of Sunday.
Same everything else — you're still one of the first 20.

Looking forward to your feedback.

—Jackson
```

**Tone:** Matter-of-fact, quality-focused, no apologetics. Sets realistic expectations.

## 🎯 Vercel Deployment Blocker Details

**Issue:** Multiple GitHub commits (718a009, eea886f, 5c473bb, 86e8b35) pushed but not auto-deploying to Vercel.

**Root Cause:** Vercel webhook/integration may not be connected, or requires manual trigger.

**Current Status:**
- Production running old code (doesn't have streaming endpoint)
- QA cannot verify fix is working
- Cannot launch until production is updated

**Solution:** Founder manually triggers deployment via Vercel dashboard ([https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → Audio Anything project → Redeploy button)

**Time to resolve:** 2-3 minutes

**Recommendation:** Handle anytime before Monday 9 AM launch. No urgency tonight given hard deadline passed.

1. Update PRIVATE-BETA-LAUNCH-PACK.md (change Sunday → Monday in timestamps)
