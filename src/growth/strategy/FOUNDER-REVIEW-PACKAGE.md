## Quick Decision Guide

### Decision 1: Brand Name

**Recommendation: Readcast**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Readcast** ✅ | Clear value prop, verb potential, broad appeal, available domains | May feel too playful for enterprise |
| Narrate | Premium positioning, simple, professional | Generic, less memorable |
| Echofeed | Distinctive, scalable platform concept | "Feed" may feel dated |
| Voiceprint | Unique, tech-forward | Harder to explain value prop |
| Audio Anything | Already built, broad scope | Generic, not ownable |

**Action needed:** Choose name → acquire domains → rebrand or keep current name

---

### Decision 2: Visual Direction

**Recommendation: Sonic Minimalism (for Readcast)**

- **Sonic Minimalism:** Clean, professional, Spotify-meets-Notion (recommended for mass market)
- **Bold Audio:** Energetic, gradients, younger audience (if targeting podcast addicts primarily)
- **Premium Simplicity:** High-end, minimal, executive audience (if pivoting upmarket)

**Action needed:** Choose direction → create logo → implement design system

---

### Decision 3: Launch Timeline

**Recommendation: Launch private beta immediately when product is ready**

- Days 1-7: Private beta (10-20 users)
- Days 8-14: Invite expansion (100-200 users, referral loop)
- Days 15-30: Public launch (ProductHunt, HN, Reddit)
- Days 31-90: Scale to $10k MRR

**Action needed:** Confirm timeline or adjust based on product readiness

---

## Revenue Projections (Aggressive)

| Milestone | Users | MRR | ARR Run Rate |
|-----------|-------|-----|--------------|
| Week 1 (Private Beta) | 20 | $20 | $240 |
| Week 2 (Invite Expansion) | 200 | $250 | $3,000 |
| Week 4 (Public Launch) | 2,000 | $1,000 | $12,000 |
| Week 12 (End of Q1) | 10,000 | $10,000 | $120,000 |

**Assumptions:**
- 70% activation rate (free users who generate audio)
- 20% trial conversion rate (free → 7-day trial)
- 50% paid conversion rate (trial → paying customer)
- $4.99/month pricing
- 10% monthly churn

**Realistic vs Stretch:**
- **Realistic:** $5k-8k MRR by Day 90
- **Aggressive:** $10k-12k MRR by Day 90
- **Moonshot:** $15k+ MRR if ProductHunt/HN both hit big

## Customer Segments (Prioritized)

### Tier 1 (Launch First):
1. **Commuters** — 30-60 min daily commute, want productive use of time
2. **Podcast Addicts** — Listen 10+ hours/week, always looking for content

### Tier 2 (Weeks 2-4):
3. **Knowledge Workers** — Read 10-30 articles/week, screen fatigue
4. **Newsletter Subscribers** — Pay for 5-10 Substacks, don't read them

### Tier 3 (Month 2+):
5. **Accessibility Users** — Dyslexia, visual impairments, need audio
6. **Content Creators** — Want to offer audio versions of their writing

**Full segment analysis:** See `customer-segments.md`

## Go-to-Market Tactics (AI-Agent-Viable)

### What We CAN Do (Effectively):
✅ **SEO & content marketing** — Write 100 blog posts, rank for long-tail keywords
✅ **Paid acquisition** — Google/Reddit ads, A/B test 50 variants
✅ **Email marketing** — Lifecycle automation, nurture sequences
✅ **Product analytics** — Deep funnel analysis, cohort studies
✅ **One-to-one outreach** — Personalized emails to Substack authors (low volume)
✅ **Community engagement** — HN Show HN, ProductHunt launch (authentic, one-time)

### What We CANNOT Do (Human Required):
❌ **Social media at scale** — Requires human authenticity signals
❌ **Influencer partnerships** — Needs trust and rapport
❌ **Press/PR** — Journalists want human stories
❌ **Large communities** — Discord/Slack moderation

**Strategy:** Focus on high-ROI, low-human-dependency channels (SEO, paid ads, email, analytics).

## Key Decisions Needed from Founder

### Immediate Decisions:
1. **Brand name:** Readcast, Narrate, Echofeed, Voiceprint, or keep Audio Anything?
2. **Visual direction:** Sonic Minimalism, Bold Audio, or Premium Simplicity?
3. **Private beta timing:** Launch as soon as product is ready, or wait for full polish?

### Week 2 Decisions:
4. **Pricing test:** Start at $4.99 or test $6.99/$9.99 in parallel?
5. **Public launch timing:** Day 15 (two weeks after beta) or earlier/later?

### Month 1 Decisions:
6. **Budget:** Bootstrap ($0-500/month) or invest in paid acquisition ($2-5k/month)?
7. **Annual plans:** Offer annual pricing ($59/year) or monthly only?

## Success Metrics (How We'll Know If This Worked)

### Private Beta (Week 1):
- ✅ 70%+ of invited users sign up
- ✅ 80%+ activation (generate at least one audio)
- ✅ 20%+ trial conversion within 48 hours
- ✅ At least 5 users say "I'd recommend this"

### Public Launch (Week 4):
- ✅ ProductHunt #1-3 Product of the Day
- ✅ Hacker News front page for 2+ hours
- ✅ 10,000+ Day 1 visitors
- ✅ 500+ new signups on launch day
- ✅ $1,000 MRR by end of Week 4

### Scale (Week 12):

- ✅ 5,000-10,000 total users
- ✅ <10% monthly churn
- ✅ LTV:CAC ratio >3:1

**If we hit these:** Raise funding, scale to $100k MRR by Month 6.
**If we miss:** Iterate, pivot, or shut down based on data.

## Risk Assessment

### Top Risks:

**1. Product isn't 10x better than alternatives**
- **Mitigation:** Voice quality must be studio-grade (ElevenLabs delivers this)
- **Test:** If <60% of beta users say "this is way better than TTS", we have a problem

**2. Pricing is wrong (too high or too low)**
- **Mitigation:** A/B test $4.99 vs $6.99 vs $9.99 in public launch
- **Fallback:** Can always lower price, harder to raise it

**3. CAC too high (paid acquisition doesn't scale)**
- **Mitigation:** Focus on organic first (SEO, viral loop, referrals)
- **Fallback:** If organic works, we don't need paid

**4. High churn (users try it once, never return)**
- **Mitigation:** Email sequences, browser extension (save from web), mobile app
- **Metric:** Track Week 2 retention — need 40%+ to have a business

**5. Competitors copy us fast**
- **Mitigation:** Speed to market, brand differentiation, integrations (Pocket, Instapaper)
- **Reality:** This WILL happen. We need 6-month head start.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors:
1. **Play.ht, Murf.ai, Descript** — General-purpose TTS (not specialized for articles)
2. **Speechify, NaturalReader** — Text-to-speech apps (lower quality voices)
3. **Pocket Premium** — Has listen feature, but robotic TTS

### Why We'll Win:
- **Better voices:** ElevenLabs is studio-quality, theirs sound robotic
- **Faster:** 30 seconds generation vs 2-5 minutes
- **Simpler:** Paste URL, done. No account setup, no complexity
- **Positioning:** "Podcast from articles" is clearer than "text-to-speech tool"

### Defensibility:
- **Brand:** First-mover in "article → podcast" category
- **Integrations:** Pocket, Instapaper, Substack partnerships (lock-in)
- **Data:** Learn which content converts best, optimize prompts
- **Network effects:** Referrals, creator-driven distribution

## What Happens Next

### If you approve this strategy:

**This week:**
1. Choose brand name (I'll acquire domains immediately)
2. Choose visual direction (I'll create logo concepts)
3. Finalize private beta launch timing (tied to product readiness)

**Week 2:**
1. Launch private beta with chosen brand
2. Monitor metrics hourly (activation, conversion, feedback)
3. Iterate based on beta user insights

**Week 3-4:**
1. Prepare ProductHunt/HN launches (demo video, copy, assets)
2. Activate referral program for beta users
3. Build landing page with chosen visual direction

**Week 4+:**
1. Execute public launch (PH + HN + Reddit same day)
2. Scale what works, cut what doesn't
3. Hit $1k MRR, then sprint to $10k

### If you want changes:

Reply with specific feedback:
- Different brand names to explore?
- Adjust revenue targets (more/less aggressive)?
- Different customer segments to prioritize?
- Changes to visual direction?
- Concerns about AI-agent-viable tactics?

I'll iterate and deliver v2 within 24 hours.
