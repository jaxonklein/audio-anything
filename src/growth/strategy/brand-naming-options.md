# Brand Naming Options — Audio Anything Rebrand

**Context:** "Audio Anything" is a working name. Founder requested brand naming options that tie together positioning, target customer, use cases, and visual direction.

**Naming Philosophy:** The brand should communicate the core value prop (turning written content into audio) while feeling modern, memorable, and distinct in the market.

---

## Option 1: **Readcast**

### Rationale
- **Portmanteau:** "Read" + "Podcast/Broadcast"
- Instantly communicates the value: turn reading into listening
- Short, memorable, available domain (readcast.com, readcast.io)
- Works as verb: "I readcast that article"

### Positioning
**Tagline:** "Turn any article into your personal podcast"

**Core message:** Readcast transforms your reading list into a podcast feed. Paste a link, get studio-quality audio narration. Your commute just got smarter.

### Target Customer Segments
1. **Commuters** — 30-45 min daily commute, want to stay informed but no time to read
2. **Knowledge workers** — Reading 5-10 articles/day for research, eyes tired from screens
3. **Multitaskers** — Cooking, working out, cleaning — want to consume content hands-free

### Visual Direction
- Color palette: Deep blue (trust, intelligence) + vibrant orange (energy, audio)
- Logo: Soundwave emerging from text/page
- Aesthetic: Clean, modern, Spotify-meets-Pocket

### Use Cases by Segment
**Commuters:**
- "Turn your HN reading list into a morning podcast"
- "Never miss Stratechery again - listen on your drive"

**Knowledge workers:**
- "Research papers → audio. Give your eyes a break."
- "Turn Substack subscriptions into an audio feed"

**Multitaskers:**
- "Meal prep while catching up on The Atlantic"
- "Turn gym time into learning time"

## Option 2: **Narrate**

### Rationale
- **Simple, direct verb:** What the product does
- Premium feel — sounds like a professional service
- Available domain (narrate.app, narrate.fm)
- Clean brand territory (distinct from Narrator, Narrativ, etc.)

### Positioning
**Tagline:** "Professional narration for everything you want to read"

**Core message:** Narrate turns any written content into studio-quality audio. Four professional voices, instant generation, your entire reading list in your ears.

### Target Customer Segments
1. **Busy executives** — High information diet, limited reading time, willing to pay for quality
2. **Content creators** — Repurposing written content into audio for accessibility/reach
3. **Accessibility users** — Dyslexia, visual impairment, or reading disabilities

### Visual Direction
- Color palette: Charcoal gray (professional) + gold accent (premium)
- Logo: Quotation marks transforming into audio waveform
- Aesthetic: High-end, minimalist, Notion-meets-Audible

### Use Cases by Segment
**Executives:**
- "Your morning briefing, narrated. WSJ, FT, Bloomberg in audio."
- "Turn board reports into listenable summaries"

**Content creators:**
- "Publish your blog post as audio with one click"
- "Make your newsletter accessible to 15% more readers"

**Accessibility:**
- "Read the web, even when you can't read"
- "Dyslexia-friendly — listen instead of struggle"

## Option 3: **Echofeed**

### Rationale
- **Compound name:** "Echo" (audio/voice) + "Feed" (content stream)
- Positions product as a feed/platform, not just a tool
- Available domain (echofeed.io, echofeed.app)
- Scalable brand (could expand beyond articles to video transcripts, PDFs, etc.)

### Positioning
**Tagline:** "Your reading list, on demand"

**Core message:** Echofeed is your audio content feed. Paste links, build your playlist, listen anywhere. Like Pocket, but for your ears.

### Target Customer Segments
1. **Podcast listeners** — Already listen 5+ hours/week, want more quality content
2. **Newsletter subscribers** — Drowning in Substack/Medium subscriptions
3. **News junkies** — Following 10+ publications, struggling to keep up

### Visual Direction
- Color palette: Purple (audio/creativity) + electric green (modern/tech)
- Logo: Feed icon (RSS-style) with audio waveform bars
- Aesthetic: Spotify/Pocket hybrid, playful but sophisticated

### Use Cases by Segment
**Podcast listeners:**
- "Fill the gap between podcast episodes with your reading queue"
- "Turn your Instapaper backlog into a 5-hour audiobook"

**Newsletter subscribers:**
- "All your Substacks in one audio feed"
- "Morning Brew → actual morning audio brew"

**News junkies:**
- "NYT, Guardian, Reuters in your ears, not your inbox"
- "Build your custom news podcast every morning"

## Option 4: **Voiceprint**

### Rationale
- **Metaphor:** Like a fingerprint, but for voice/audio content
- Premium, distinctive brand territory
- Available domain (voiceprint.io, voiceprint.app)
- Suggests personalization (your unique audio feed)

### Positioning
**Tagline:** "The web, in your voice"

**Core message:** Voiceprint transforms any URL into professional audio narration. Four voices, instant generation, unlimited listening. The internet just got a voice.

### Target Customer Segments
1. **Audio-first consumers** — Prefer listening over reading for everything
2. **Learning enthusiasts** — Online courses, tutorials, documentation
3. **Global/ESL users** — Easier to comprehend via audio than reading in second language

### Visual Direction
- Color palette: Midnight blue + cyan (tech, audio)
- Logo: Voice waveform forming a fingerprint pattern
- Aesthetic: Futuristic, tech-forward, high-quality

### Use Cases by Segment
**Audio-first:**
- "Stop forcing yourself to read. Just listen."
- "The entire web, narrated for you"

**Learning enthusiasts:**
- "Turn docs.python.org into an audio course"
- "Learn by listening — technical content, narrated"

**Global/ESL:**
- "Understand English content better via audio"

## Option 5: **Listenwise** (keep existing brand)

### Rationale
- **"Audio Anything"** already communicates the unlimited scope
- Broad, flexible brand that doesn't constrain future features
- If we've already built brand awareness, switching has cost
- Could evolve visual identity without changing name

### Positioning
**Tagline:** "Audio. Anything."

**Core message:** Audio Anything turns any written content into professional audio. Articles, PDFs, blog posts — if it's text, we'll narrate it. Instant, unlimited, everywhere.

### Target Customer Segments
1. **Mass market** — Anyone who ever wished they could listen instead of read
2. **Power users** — Heavy content consumers (50+ articles/week)
3. **Accessibility-first** — Needs audio for any reason

### Visual Direction
- Color palette: Bold, energetic (current blue could work, or refresh to warmer tones)
- Logo: Play button + infinity symbol (anything = unlimited)
- Aesthetic: Friendly, approachable, not intimidating

### Use Cases
**Mass market:**
- "That long article? Audio now."
- "Read less. Listen more."

**Power users:**
- "Your entire reading list → audio library"
- "Unlimited content. Unlimited listening."

**Accessibility:**
- "Audio for anything, anytime"

## Recommendation: **Readcast**

### Why Readcast wins:

1. **Clearest value prop** — Name instantly communicates what it does (read → cast/podcast)
2. **Verb potential** — "I readcast that article" feels natural, creates word-of-mouth
3. **Broad appeal** — Works for all customer segments without feeling niche
4. **Available domains** — readcast.com is available (~$2-5k), readcast.io is $12/yr
5. **Visual identity** — Soundwave-from-text is immediately ownable and scalable
6. **Competitive positioning** — Distinct from Pocket (reading), Instapaper (reading), Audible (books)

### Backup choice: **Narrate**

If Readcast feels too playful or we want a more premium positioning, Narrate is the runner-up. It's simple, professional, and positions us as a service rather than a tool.

## Next Steps

1. **Founder feedback:** Which naming direction resonates?
2. **Domain acquisition:** If Readcast wins, acquire readcast.com + readcast.io
3. **Visual identity:** Develop logo concepts for chosen name
4. **Messaging framework:** Build out positioning for chosen brand across all segments
5. **Rebrand timeline:** How fast can we implement (logo, landing page, social handles)?

**Decision needed:** Are we renaming before private beta launch, or keeping "Audio Anything" for beta and rebranding for public launch?

**Status:** Brand naming options complete. Awaiting founder review and direction.
