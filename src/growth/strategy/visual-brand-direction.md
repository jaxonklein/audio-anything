# Visual Brand Direction — Audio Anything / Readcast

**Context:** Visual identity concepts to accompany brand naming options. This defines look, feel, color, typography, and ownable visual assets.

---

## Core Brand Attributes (Regardless of Name Choice)

**What the brand must convey:**
1. **Quality** — Studio-grade audio, not robotic TTS
2. **Speed** — Instant, effortless, no friction
3. **Intelligence** — Smart content transformation
4. **Accessibility** — Inclusive, helpful, human
5. **Modern** — Tech-forward, not legacy

**What to avoid:**
- Corporate/sterile (this isn't enterprise software)
- Playful/childish (this is for professionals)
- Cluttered/busy (simplicity is key)
- Cold/robotic (warmth, humanity)

## Dark Mode Strategy

**Approach:** Dark mode is NOT an afterthought. It's a first-class experience.

**Why dark mode matters for this product:**
1. **Audience:** Tech workers, night usage, screen fatigue
2. **Context:** Listening at night, in bed, low-light environments
3. **Differentiation:** Many competitors don't support dark mode well

**Implementation:**
- True black (#000000 or #0A0E14) not dark gray
- Reduce contrast slightly (off-white text, not pure white)
- Invert shadows (use subtle glows instead)
- Test all colors for readability in both modes
- User preference respected (no auto-switching)

---

## Accessibility (Visual)

**WCAG AAA Compliance:**
- Color contrast ratios >7:1 for text
- Never rely on color alone (use icons + text)
- Focus states visible and distinct
- Text scalable to 200% without breaking layout
- Motion can be disabled (respect prefers-reduced-motion)

**Inclusive design:**
- Large tap targets (44x44px minimum)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent UI patterns
- Alt text on all images
- Captions on demo videos

---

## Motion & Animation Principles

**What to animate:**
- Page transitions (subtle fade/slide)
- Button hovers (scale 1.02x)
- Loading states (skeleton screens, progress)
- Audio waveform (visualizer during playback)
- Scroll-triggered reveals (hero elements)

**What NOT to animate:**
- Random, distracting movements
- Auto-playing videos
- Flashing/strobing effects
- Parallax (overused, accessibility issues)

**Performance:**
- Use CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated)
- Debounce scroll events
- Lazy load images
- Optimize animations for 60fps

---

## Responsive Design Breakpoints

**Mobile:** 320px - 767px
- Single column
- Simplified navigation
- Touch-optimized buttons
- Bottom sheet modals

**Tablet:** 768px - 1023px
- Two columns where appropriate
- Hybrid nav (collapsible)
- Optimized for iPad usage

**Desktop:** 1024px+
- Full navigation
- Multi-column layouts
- Hover states
- Keyboard shortcuts

**Priority:** Mobile-first. 60-70% of traffic will be mobile.

---

## Component Library (Design System)

**Core components to design:**
1. Buttons (primary, secondary, ghost, destructive)
2. Input fields (text, URL, search)
3. Cards (article, audio item, pricing)
4. Audio player (custom, branded)
5. Modals/dialogs
6. Toast notifications
7. Loading states (skeleton, spinner, progress)
8. Navigation (header, mobile menu)
9. Footer
10. Form elements (checkbox, toggle, select)

**Design in Figma, build in:**
- React components (Tailwind CSS)
- Radix UI primitives (accessible)
- Framer Motion (animations)

---

## Brand Voice (Visual Tone)

**Readcast/Sonic Minimalism:**
- Clean, confident, helpful
- "Your reading list, reimagined"

**Echofeed/Bold Audio:**
- Energetic, playful, modern
- "Turn the web into your soundtrack"
- Fun without being childish

**Narrate/Premium Simplicity:**

- Sophisticated, not stuffy

---

## Next Steps (After Brand Direction Chosen)

1. **Create logo variations** (horizontal, stacked, icon-only)
2. **Build Figma design system** (components, colors, typography)
3. **Design landing page mockups** (3 variations for A/B testing)
4. **Create marketing asset templates** (social, email, blog)
5. **Develop brand guidelines doc** (logo usage, color codes, dos/don'ts)
6. **Implement in code** (Tailwind config, component library)
