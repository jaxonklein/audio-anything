# Go-to-Market Strategy — Audio Anything / Readcast

**Timeline:** Days, not weeks. Aggressive growth targets. Private beta → Public launch → Revenue scale.

**Constraint:** Marketing tactics must be viable for AI agents. No social media spam, no fake engagement, no tactics requiring human authenticity signals.

---

## Phase 1: Private Beta (Days 1-7)

### Goal
Validate product-market fit with 10-20 invited users. Achieve 70%+ activation, 20%+ trial conversion, collect qualitative feedback.

### Audience
Friends, colleagues, early adopters in founder's network. People who will give honest feedback and tolerate bugs.

### Distribution
- ✅ WhatsApp direct messages with unique invite codes (already planned)
- Private demo for each user if they request it
- Direct founder involvement in onboarding

### Success Metrics
- **Sign-up rate:** 70%+ of invited users create accounts
- **Activation rate:** 80%+ generate at least one audio
- **Engagement:** 3+ generations per user average
- **Trial conversion:** 20%+ start 7-day trial within 48 hours
- **Qualitative:** At least 5 users say "I would recommend this" unprompted

### Revenue Target (Private Beta)
- **MRR potential:** $99 (20 users × 20% trial rate × $4.99/month = 4 trials × $4.99)
- This phase is about learning, not revenue
- But we prove people will pay

### Key Activities
1. Send invites Day 1 (launch day)
2. Monitor analytics hourly (Day 1-2), then daily
3. Personally reach out to every user who signs up (via chat widget or email)
4. Ask for feedback: "What would make this 10x better?"
5. Fix critical bugs within 24 hours of discovery
6. Document feature requests and pain points

### AI-Agent-Viable Tactics
- ✅ One-to-one communication (chat widget, email responses)
- ✅ Analytics monitoring and data analysis
- ✅ Bug triage and prioritization
- ✅ Documentation and feedback synthesis
- ❌ Social proof generation (fake reviews/testimonials)
- ❌ Community management at scale

---

## Phase 2: Invite-Only Expansion (Days 8-14)

### Goal
Grow to 100-200 users while maintaining quality. Iterate based on beta feedback. Build word-of-mouth loop.

### Audience
- Beta users' referrals (incentivized)
- Targeted outreach to power users in specific niches:
  - Newsletter writers (Substack, Beehiiv authors)
  - Podcast listeners (active on Overcast, Pocket Casts)
  - Knowledge workers (active on HN, Lobsters, IndieHackers)

### Distribution
1. **Referral program** — Give beta users 5 invite codes each
   - Incentive: "Invite 3 friends → get 1 month free"
   - Track via unique codes (BETA-USERNAME-001, etc.)

3. **Community engagement** (AI-agent-viable with constraints)
   - Post on HN Show HN (one-time, authentic)
   - Reply to relevant threads on /r/productivity, /r/podcasts (helpful, not spammy)
   - Goal: 100-500 upvotes on HN → 500-2000 signups

## Marketing Tactics: AI-Agent Constraints

### What AI Agents CAN Do Effectively

1. **Data analysis & optimization**
   - Funnel analysis, cohort studies, attribution modeling
   - A/B testing (pricing, messaging, landing pages)
   - SQL queries, dashboard creation, trend identification

2. **Content creation (text-based)**
   - Blog posts, landing page copy, email sequences
   - SEO keyword research and optimization
   - Documentation, help articles, FAQs

3. **One-to-one communication**
   - Email responses to user questions
   - Chat widget support
   - Personalized outreach (low volume, high quality)

4. **Programmatic marketing**
   - Paid ads (Google, Reddit, Facebook)
   - Email automation (drip campaigns, lifecycle emails)
   - Referral program mechanics

5. **Product-led growth**
   - In-app messaging and upgrade prompts
   - Onboarding flow optimization
   - Feature gating and conversion optimization

### What AI Agents CANNOT Do (or shouldn't)

1. **Social media at scale**
   - Twitter posting requires human authenticity signals
   - Fake engagement (likes, retweets, replies) is detectable and backfires
   - Exception: Occasional authentic posts (Show HN, ProductHunt) are fine

2. **Influencer relationships**
   - Partnerships require trust and human rapport
   - Cold outreach to influencers is low-conversion
   - Exception: Affiliate program (self-serve, transactional)

3. **Community building**
   - Discord/Slack communities need human moderation
   - Forum participation at scale feels inauthentic
   - Exception: Supporting existing community (responding to questions)

4. **PR and press**
   - Journalists want human stories, not AI pitches
   - Exception: Founder can do press, AI can draft pitches

5. **Content requiring human perspective**
   - Personal stories, founder journey, customer interviews
   - Exception: AI can transcribe and edit, human provides raw material

### Recommended Focus for AI Agents

**High ROI, low human-dependency:**
1. SEO content (write 100 blog posts, rank for long-tail keywords)
2. Paid acquisition (test 50 ad variants, optimize for CAC)
3. Email marketing (automate lifecycle, nurture, winback)
4. Analytics (find insights humans miss in the data)
5. Product optimization (A/B test every pixel, maximize conversions)

**Leave to humans (or founder):**
1. Press outreach and interviews
2. Partnership negotiations
3. Social media presence (founder's personal accounts)
4. Community leadership
5. High-touch sales (if we add enterprise tier)

## Revenue Model Evolution

### Phase 1-2: Single Plan (Private Beta)
- $4.99/month, 7-day trial
- 200 generations/month, 100 saved links
- Simple, easy to explain

### Phase 3: A/B Test Pricing (Public Launch)
Test three price points:
- **A:** $4.99/month (current)
- **B:** $6.99/month (+40%)
- **C:** $9.99/month (+100%)

Hypothesis: Conversion won't drop significantly at $6.99, revenue per user increases 40%.

### Phase 4: Tiered Pricing (Days 31+)

**Free:**
- 3 generations/hour (36/day max)
- 1-hour link expiry
- All 4 voices

**Pro ($6.99/month or $59/year):**
- 200 generations/month
- 100 saved links
- Permanent links
- Priority generation (faster)

**Premium ($14.99/month or $119/year):**
- Unlimited generations
- Unlimited saved links
- API access (for integrations)
- Custom voice training (future feature)
- Team sharing (up to 5 people)

Expected mix: 85% free, 12% Pro, 3% Premium

**MRR at 10,000 users:**
- 1,200 Pro × $6.99 = $8,388
- 300 Premium × $14.99 = $4,497
- **Total: $12,885 MRR**

### Annual Plans
- Pro: $59/year (save $24, 2 months free)
- Premium: $119/year (save $60, 4 months free)

Annual plans reduce churn and improve cash flow. Target: 30% of paid users choose annual by Month 3.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Low conversion (free → paid)
**Mitigation:**
- A/B test pricing ($4.99 vs $6.99)
- Improve upgrade prompts (7 variants already created)
- Add annual plan (psychological commitment)
- Implement referral incentives (free month for 3 referrals)

### Risk: High churn
**Mitigation:**
- Email sequences to drive habit formation (Day 1, 3, 7, 14)
- In-app notifications when new content is saved
- Browser extension (save articles directly from web)
- Mobile app (listen on the go)

### Risk: CAC too high (paid acquisition doesn't scale)
**Mitigation:**
- Double down on organic (SEO, content, viral loop)
- Partnerships (Pocket, Instapaper integrations)
- Product-led growth (invite friends for free generations)

### Risk: Product isn't 10x better than alternatives
**Mitigation:**
- Voice quality must be studio-grade (ElevenLabs delivers this)
- Speed must be instant (<30 seconds generation)
- UX must be dead simple (paste URL, done)
- If we don't nail these, pivot or shut down

## Decision Points

### Now (Founder Review)
1. **Brand name:** Readcast, Narrate, Echofeed, Voiceprint, or keep Audio Anything?
2. **Private beta timing:** Launch immediately when product ready, or wait for polish?
3. **Pricing:** Start at $4.99 or test higher ($6.99)?

### Day 7 (End of Private Beta)
1. **Product-market fit:** Do beta users love it (70%+ would recommend)?
2. **Conversion:** Are people willing to pay (20%+ trial starts)?
3. **Go/no-go for public launch:** If PMF is weak, iterate another week

### Day 15 (Public Launch)
1. **Channel success:** Did PH/HN/Reddit drive 5k+ visitors?
2. **Activation:** Are new users converting at 60%+?
3. **Paid acquisition:** Test $500 budget, scale if ROAS > 3x

### Day 30 (End of Month 1)
1. **MRR milestone:** Did we hit $1,000 MRR?
2. **Growth channels:** Which channels are working (double down) vs failing (cut)?
3. **Pricing test:** Did higher pricing ($6.99) improve revenue without killing conversion?

### Day 90 (End of Quarter 1)
1. **$10k MRR milestone:** Did we hit it? If not, why not?
2. **Unit economics:** Is LTV:CAC > 3:1? If not, fix before scaling further
3. **Next phase:** Raise funding, stay bootstrapped, or pivot?

**Status:** Go-to-market plan complete. Aggressive timelines, realistic revenue targets, AI-agent-viable tactics. Ready for founder review.
