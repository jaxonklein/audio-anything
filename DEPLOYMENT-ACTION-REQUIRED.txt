⚠️ DEPLOYMENT ACTION REQUIRED - READ IMMEDIATELY ⚠️

TIME: 8:50 PM CT (20:50 UTC)
DEADLINE: 9:45 PM CT (21:45 UTC) — 55 MINUTES REMAINING

PROBLEM:
========
Vercel auto-deployment has NOT picked up the latest code commits.
Production is running OLD code (missing the audio loop bug fix).

EVIDENCE:
=========
✓ Code is committed and pushed to GitHub (commit 5c473bb)
✓ Engineer's fix works perfectly locally (tested: audio plays 4.876s complete)
✗ Production console does NOT have diagnostic log [AudioPlayer] Version 718a009
✗ QA reports audio still loops in production (same as all previous failures)

CONCLUSION:
===========
Production = OLD CODE
Local = NEW CODE (FIXED)

This is why the engineer's tests pass but production fails.

SOLUTION - REQUIRES MANUAL ACTION:
==================================
Founder: Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Find audio-anything-lac project
- Click "Redeploy" on the latest commit (5c473bb)
- Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete

Expected result: Production will have the fix and audio will play correctly.

VERIFICATION:
=============
After deployment:
1. Refresh https://audio-anything-lac.vercel.app (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Console
3. Should see: [AudioPlayer] Version 718a009 loaded - fix deployed
4. If present: FIX IS DEPLOYED ✓
5. If absent: Deployment failed, escalate to Vercel
