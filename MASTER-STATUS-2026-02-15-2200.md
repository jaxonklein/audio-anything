## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Technical Analysis
**The Bug:** Audio looped after 1-2 seconds instead of playing complete articles

**Root Cause:** Browser's seeking behavior on base64-encoded data URLs breaks for larger files

**The Fix:** Replace data URLs with HTTP streaming endpoint (`/api/audio/[id]`)

**Code Quality:** Complete, tested locally, ready for production

**Full Details:** See LAUNCH-DELAY-SUMMARY.md

### Strategic Insights
**Why Monday Makes Sense:**
- ✅ Time to verify fix works in production
- ✅ QA can do thorough testing
- ✅ CEO can review product end-to-end
- ✅ Maintains founder credibility with early users
- ✅ Same operations plan, just 24-hour delay

**Why Sunday Was Blocked:**
- ❌ No time to verify fix in production
- ❌ Risk of launching broken product
- ❌ Damage to founder credibility
- ❌ No margin for error

**Leadership Decision:**
Founder correctly prioritized quality over speed. Better to delay 12 hours than to risk credibility.

**Q: Is the product fix working?**
A: Code is complete and tested locally. Awaiting Vercel deployment to verify in production.
