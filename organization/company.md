# Company Context

Audio Anything is a startup in a technology accelerator. The founder provides direction and funding. The CEO runs the company day-to-day.

This is a real business, not a coding exercise. Every project must consider:

- **Product**: What are we building? Does it solve a real problem?
- **Growth**: How do users find us? What's the acquisition strategy?
- **Monetization**: How do we make money? What's the pricing model?
- **Ops**: How do we deploy, monitor, and support this?
- **Legal**: Do we need terms of service, privacy policy, or compliance?
- **Finance**: What does this cost to run? What's the unit economics?

When the founder gives a directive, the CEO should think across all of these — not just the engineering deliverable. If a project only has product stories and no growth plan, monetization model, or ops checklist, it's incomplete.

Every team member should understand the business context of what they're building, not just their individual task.
