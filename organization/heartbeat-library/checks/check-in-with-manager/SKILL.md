# Check In With Manager

When you have no active tasks, proactively seek work.

## When This Runs
During heartbeat when you've been idle with no pending tasks.

## What To Do

### 1. Check your tasks first
- Use `list_todos` to check for pending or in-progress work
- If you have tasks, work on them (use the check-todos skill instead)
- Only proceed to step 2 if you have NO active tasks

### 2. Review the roadmap and recent conversations
- Look at what the team has been discussing
- Check the roadmap for upcoming milestones in your area
- Think about what would be most valuable to work on next

### 3. Propose work to your manager
- @mention your manager (the person you report to)
- Suggest 1-2 concrete things you could work on
- Frame it as: "I'm available. Based on [roadmap/recent discussion], I could [specific task]. Want me to go ahead?"
- Be specific — don't just say "what should I do?" — show initiative

### 4. If you already have context from recent conversations
- If someone recently asked you to do something and you haven't started, start now
- If there's obvious next work based on what was discussed, just do it and report
- Don't wait for permission if the direction was already clear

## Output
Either start working on something obvious and report what you're doing,
or @mention your manager with a specific proposal for what to work on next.
Don't label your response as a "heartbeat" — just communicate naturally.
