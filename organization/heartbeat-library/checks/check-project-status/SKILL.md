# Check Project Status

Review the current state of the project and ensure the team is making progress.

## When This Runs
During heartbeat (you've been idle). This is your chance to lead proactively.

## What To Do

### 1. Review recent channel activity
- Look at what your team has posted recently
- Check if anyone reported completing work, hitting blockers, or asking questions

### 2. Check if everyone has clear next steps
- Does each team member have active work?
- Has anyone gone quiet who should be producing output?
- If someone seems idle, @mention them and ask for a status update

### 3. Unblock the team
- If someone asked a question and nobody answered, answer it or route it
- If a decision is needed, make the call
- If resources are needed (API keys, accounts, approvals), flag it to the human

### 4. Drive toward the goal
- Check the roadmap — are we on track?
- If work is done, identify and assign the next milestone
- Create tasks for team members who need direction
- Push for shipping: "What's the next thing we can demo?"

### 5. Delegate, don't do
- You are the CEO. Your job is to ensure the team is effective.
- @mention specific people with specific asks
- Give context, deadline, and expected output
- Trust your team to execute once directed

## Output
Post a brief status update or delegation message in your primary channel.
If everything is on track, a one-liner is fine.
If action is needed, @mention the relevant people with clear tasks.
Don't label your response as a "heartbeat" — just communicate naturally.
