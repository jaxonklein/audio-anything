URGENT: MANUAL DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED FOR LAUNCH
================================================================================

TO: jaxonklein (founder)
FROM: Jonah Ekberg (Chief of Staff - Operations)
TIME: 8:50 PM CT (20:50 UTC)
DEADLINE: 9:45 PM CT (21:45 UTC) — 55 MINUTES

ACTION REQUIRED RIGHT NOW:
=========================

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find project: audio-anything-lac
3. Click: "Redeploy" on the latest commit (5c473bb)
4. Wait: 2-3 minutes for build to complete

WHY:
====
The audio loop bug FIX is committed and pushed to GitHub (✓) but
Vercel's auto-deployment is NOT picking it up (✗).

Production is running OLD CODE without the fix.
That's why the engineer's local tests pass but production fails.

The solution: ONE manual redeploy from Vercel dashboard.

PROOF:
======
✓ Engineer's fix: commit 718a009 (working perfectly locally)
✓ Commits pushed: 5c473bb visible on origin/master
✗ Production code: Missing diagnostic log — proves old code running
✗ QA test: Audio still loops in production (same as before fix)

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER REDEPLOY:
============================
20:55 - You click Redeploy
21:00 - Build completes, new code live
21:05 - CoS verifies fix in production console
21:10 - QA re-tests audio playback
21:15 - CEO signs off
21:30 - Launch execution

TIMELINE:
=========
You need to act now. Once you click Redeploy, everything else happens
automatically. 55 minutes is plenty of buffer.

VERIFY IT WORKED:
=================
After deployment completes:
1. Open: https://audio-anything-lac.vercel.app
2. Press: F12 (DevTools)
3. Go to: Console tab
4. Look for: "[AudioPlayer] Version 718a009 loaded - fix deployed"
5. If present: ✅ SUCCESS
6. If absent: ❌ Deployment failed (tell CoS)
